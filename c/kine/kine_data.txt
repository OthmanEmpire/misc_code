An 55.0-N crate of apples sits at rest on a ramp that runs from the ground to the bed of a truck. The ramp is inclined at 18.0° to the ground. 
(a) What is the normal force exerted on the crate by the ramp? 
(b) The interaction partner of this normal force has what magnitude and direction? 
(c) What is the static frictional force exerted on the crate by the ramp? 
(d) What is the minimum possible value of the coefficient of static friction? 
(e) The normal and frictional forces are perpendicular components of the contact force exerted on the crate by the ramp. What is the magnitude and direction of the contact force? 


And this question 
A crate of potatoes of mass 19.0 kg is on a ramp with angle of incline 30° to the horizontal. The coefficients of friction are µs = 0.70 and µ k = 0.45. Find the frictional force (magnitude and direction) on the crate if the crate is sliding down the ramp. 

Please show how to do it!
